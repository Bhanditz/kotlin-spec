## Overload resolution

Kotlin supports _function overloading_, that is, the ability for several functions of the same name to coexist in the same scope, with the compiler picking the most suitable one when such a function is called.
This section describes this mechanism in detail.

### Intro

Unlike other object-oriented languages, Kotlin does not only have object methods, but also top-level functions, local functions, extension functions and function-like values, which complicate the overloading process quite a lot.
Kotlin also has infix functions, operator and property overloading which all work in a similar, but subtly different way.

### Receivers

Every function or property that is defined as a method or an extension has one or more special parameters called _receiver_ parameters.
When calling such a callable using navigation operators (`.` or `?.`) the left hand side parameter is called an _explicit receiver_ of this particular call.
In addition to the explicit receiver, each call may indirectly access zero or more _implicit receivers_.

Implicit receivers are available in some syntactic scope according to the following rules:

- All receivers available in an outer scope are also available in the nested scope;
- In the scope of a classifier declaration, the following receivers are available:
    - The implicit `this` object of the declared type;
    - The companion object (if one exists) of this class;
    - The companion objects (if any exist) of all its superclasses;
- If a function or a property is an extension, `this` parameter of the extension is also available inside the extension declaration;
- The scope of a lambda expression, if it has an extension function type, contains `this` argument of the lambda expression.

TODO(If I'm a companion object, is a companion object of my supertype an implicit receiver for me or not?)

The available receivers are prioritized in the following way:

- The receivers provided in the most inner scope have higher priority;
- In a classifier body, the implicit `this` receiver has higher priority than any companion object receiver;
- Current class companion object receiver has higher priority than any of the base class companion objects.

The implicit receiver having the highest priority is also called the _default implicit receiver_.
The default implicit receiver is available in the scope as `this`.
Other available receivers may be accessed using [labeled this-expressions][This-expressions].

If an implicit receiver is available in a given scope, it may be used to call functions implicitely in that scope without using the navigation operator.

### The forms of call-expression

Any function in Kotlin may be called in several different ways:

- A fully-qualified call: `package.foo()`;
- A call with an explicit receiver: `a.foo()`;
- An infix function call: `a foo b`;
- An overloaded operator call: `a + b`;
- A call without an explicit receiver: `foo()`.

For each of these cases, a compiler should first pick a number of _overload candidates_, which form a set of possibly intended callables (_overload candidate set_), and then _choose the most specific function_ to call based on the types of the function and the call arguments.

> Important: the overload candidates are picked **before** the most specific function is chosen.

### Callables and `invoke` convention

A *callable* $X$ for the purpose of this section is one of the following:

- A function named $X$ at its declaration site;
- A property named $X$ at its declaration site with an operator function called
  `invoke` available as member or extension in the current scope.

In the latter case a call $X(Y_0,Y_1,\ldots,Y_N)$ is an overloadable operator which is expanded to $X\text{.invoke}(Y_0,Y_1,\ldots,Y_N)$.
The call may contain type parameters, named parameters, variable argument parameter expansion and trailing lambda parameters, all of which are forwarded as-is to the corresponding `invoke` function.

A *member callable* is either a member function or a member property with a member operator `invoke`.
An *extension callable* is either an extension function, a member property with an extension operator `invoke` or an extension property with an extension operator `invoke`.

When calculating overload candidate sets, member callables produce the following separate sets (ordered by higher priority first):

- Member functions;
- Member properties.

Extension callables produce the following separate sets (ordered by higher priority first):

- Extension functions;
- Member properties with extension invoke;
- Extension properties with member invoke;
- Extension properties with extension invoke.

Let us define this partition as c-level partition (callable-level partition).
As this partition is the most fine-grained of all other steps of partitioning resolution candidates into sets, it is always performed last, after all other applicable steps.

### Overload resolution for a fully-qualified call

If a callable name is fully-qualified (that is, it contains a full package path), then the overload candidate set $S$ simply contains all the callables with the specified name in the specified package.
As a package name can never clash with any other declared entity, after performing c-level partition on $S$, the resulting sets are the only ones available for further processing.

TODO(Clear up this mess)

Example:
```kotlin
package a.b.c

fun foo(a: Int) {}
fun foo(a: Double) {}
fun foo(a: List<Char>) {}
val foo = {}
. . .
a.b.c.foo()
```

Here the resulting overload candidate set contains all the callables named `foo` from the package `a.b.c`.

### A call with an explicit receiver

If a function call is done via a [navigation operator][Navigation operators] (`.` or `?.`, not to be confused with a [fully-qualified call][Overload resolution for a fully-qualified call]), then the left hand side operand of the call is the explicit receiver of this call.

A call of callable `f` with an explicit receiver `e` is correct if one (or more) of the following holds:

1. `f` is a member callable of the classifier type of `e` or any of its supertypes;
2. `f` is an extension callable of the classifier type of `e` or any of its supertypes, including local and imported extensions.

> Important: callables for case 2 include not only top-level extension callables, but also extension callables from any of the available implicit receivers.
> For example, if class $P$ contains a member extension function for another class $T$ and an object of class $P$ is available as an implicit receiver, this extension function may be used for the call if it has a suitable type.

If a call is correct, for a callable named `f` with an explicit receiver `e` of type `T` the following sets are analyzed (in the given order):

TODO(Sync with scopes and stuff when we have them)

1. The sets of non-extension member callables named `f` of type `T`;
2. The sets of local extension callables named `f`, whose receiver type conforms to type `T`, in all declaration scopes containing the current declaration scope, ordered by the size of the scope (smallest first), excluding the package scope;
3. The sets of explicitly imported extension callables named `f`, whose receiver type conforms to type `T`;
4. The sets of extension callables named `f`, whose receiver type conforms to type `T`, declared in the package scope;
5. The sets of star-imported extension callables named `f`, whose receiver type conforms to type `T`;
6. The sets of implicitly imported extension callables named `f`, whose receiver type conforms to type `T`.

> Note: here type `U` conforms to type `T`, if $T <: U$.

TODO(all these X-imported things need to be defined somewhere)

When analyzing these sets, the **first** set that contains **any** callable with the corresponding name and conforming types is picked.
This means, among other things, that if the set constructed on step 2 contains the overall most suitable candidate function, but the set constructed on step 1 is not empty, the functions from set 1 will be picked despite them being less suitable overload candidates.

### Infix function calls

Infix function calls are a special case of function calls with an explicit receiver in the left hand side position, i.e., `a foo b` may be an infix form of `a.foo(b)`.

However, there is an important difference: during the overload candidate set construction the only functions considered for inclusion are the ones with the `infix` modifier.
All other functions (and any properties) are not even considered for inclusion.
Aside from this difference, candidates are selected using the same rules as for normal calls with explicit receiver.

> Note: this also means that all properties available through the `invoke` convention are non-eligible for infix calls, as there is no way of specifying the `infix` modifier for them.

Different platform implementations may extend the set of functions considered as infix functions for the overload candidate set.

### Operator calls

According to TODO(), some operator expressions in Kotlin can be overloaded using specially-named functions.
This makes operator expressions semantically equivalent to function calls with explicit receiver, where the receiver expression is selected based on the operator used (see TODO()).
The selection of an exact function called in each particular case is based on the same rules as for function calls with explicit receivers, the only difference being that only functions with `operator` modifier are considered for inclusion when building overload candidate sets.
Any properties are never considered for the overload candidate sets of operator calls.

> Note: this also means that all the properties available through the `invoke`convention are non-eligible for operator calls, as there is no way of specifying the `operator` modifier for them, even though the `invoke` callable is required to always have such modifier.
> As `invoke` convention itself is an operator call, it is impossible to use more than one `invoke` conventions in a single call.

Different platform implementations may extend the set of functions considered as operator functions for the overload candidate set.

> Note: these rules are valid not only for dedicated operator expressions, but also for any calls arising from expanding [`for`-loop][For-loop statement] iteration conventions, [assignments][Assignments] or [property delegates][Delegated property declaration].

### A call without an explicit receiver

A call which is performed with unqualified function name and without using a navigation operator is a call without an explicit receiver.
It may have one or more implicit receivers or reference a top-level function.

As with function calls with explicit receiver, we should first pick a valid overload candidate set and then search this set for the _most specific function_ to match the call.

For a function named `f` the following sets are analyzed (in the given order):

1. The sets of local non-extension functions named `f` available in the current scope, in order of the scope they are declared in, smallest scope first;
2. The overload candidate sets for each implicit receiver `r` and `f`, calculated as if `r` is the explicit receiver, in order of the receiver priority (see the [corresponding section][A call with an explicit receiver]);
3. Top-level non-extension functions named `f`, in the order of:
   a. Functions explicitely imported into current file;
   b. Functions declared in the same package;
   c. Functions star-imported into current file;
   d. Implicitly imported functions (either Kotlin standard library or platform-specific ones).

When analyzing these sets, the **first** set which contains **any** function with the corresponding name and conforming types is picked.

### Calls with named parameters

Most of the calls in Kotlin may use named parameters in call expressions, e.g., `f(a = 2)`, where `a` is a parameter specified in the declaration of `f`.
Such calls are treated the same way as normal calls, but the overload resolution sets are filtered to only contain callables which have matching formal parameters for all named parameters from the call.

> Note: for properties called via `invoke` convention, the named parameters must be present in the declaration of the `invoke` operator function.

Unlike positional arguments, named arguments are matched by name directly to their respective formal parameters; this matching is performed separately for each function candidate.
While the number of defaults (see [the MSC selection process][Choosing the most specific function from the overload candidate set]) does affect resolution process, the fact that some argument was or was not mapped as a named argument does not affect this process in any way.

### Calls with trailing lambda expressions

Most of the call forms listed above may have a single lambda expression presented outside
of the parentheses or replacing them (see [Call expression]). This has no effect on
overload resolution process, aside from argument reordering that may happen due to
variable argument parameters or parameters with defaults between the arguments.

> This means that calls `f(1,2){ g() } ` and `f(1,2, body = { g() })` are completely equivalent
> from the overload resolution standpoint, assuming that `body` is the name
> of the last formal parameter of `f`

### Calls with specified type parameters

Most of the call forms listed above may have a list of type arguments that precedes
the list of value arguments of the call. In this case, all the potential overload
sets only include callables that contain an exactly same number of formal type
arguments at declaration site. In the case of property callable through `invoke`
convention, the type parameters must be present at the `invoke` operator function
declaration.

### Determining function applicability for a specific call

#### Rationale

A function is *applicable* for a specific call if and only if the function type
parameters may be assigned the values of the arguments specified in the call and
all the type constraints of the function still hold.

#### Description

Determining function applicability for a specific call is a
[type constraint][Type constraints] problem.
First, for every argument of the function supplied in the call,
the type inference is performed. This excludes lambda arguments, as
the inference of the specific type for them needs the results of overloading
to finish.

After that the following constraint system is built:

- For every parameter of the call (excluding lambda parameters) inferred to have
  type $T_i$, corresponding to function argument of type $U_j$,
  a constraint $T_i <: U_j$ is constructed;
- All the declaration-site type constraints for the function are also added to the system;
- For each lambda parameter with the number of lambda arguments known to be $K$,
  a constraint and corresponding to function argument of type $U_m$,
  an artificial constraint is added in the form $R(L_1,...,L_K) <: U_m$,
  where $R, L_1, ..., L_K$ are all fresh variables;
- For each lambda parameter with the number of lambda arguments not known
  (that is, being equal to 0 or 1), an artificial constraint is added in the
  form $kotlin.Function <: U_m$, where $kotlin.Function$ is the common base
  of all functional types; TODO(): what's the name???

If this constraint system is sound, the function is applicable for the call.
Only applicable functions are considered for the next step: finding the most
specific overload candidate from the candidate set.

### Choosing the most specific function from the overload candidate set

#### Rationale

The main rationale behind choosing the most specific function from a candidate set
is that the function chosen could be easily forwarded to by all the other functions
in the set, while the reverse is not true. If there are several functions with
this property, none of them is the most specific and an ambiguity error should
be reported by the compiler.

Let's look at an example with two functions:

```kotlin
fun f(arg: Int, arg2: String) {}        // (1)
fun f(arg: Any?, arg2: CharSequence) {} // (2)
...
f(2, "Hello")
```

Here both functions are applicable for the call, but also function (1) could easily
call function (2) by forwarding both arguments into it, but the reverse is impossible.
As a result, function (1) is more specific of the two.
Let's rename the functions to make it more clear:

```kotlin
fun f1(arg: Int, arg2: String) {
    f2(arg, arg2) // perfectly valid
}
fun f2(arg: Any?, arg2: CharSequence) {
    f1(arg, arg2) // invalid: function f1 is not appicable
}
```

The rest of this section will try to clarify this mechanism a little more.

#### Description

When an overload resolution set is picked up and contains more than one callable,
the next step is to find the most appropriate candidate from these callables.

Firts, the appicable set is divided into two sub-sets: the callables that employ
type parameters (generic callables) and the callables that don't (non-generic callables).
If there are any non-generic applicable candidates, the choise is limited only to
non-generic subset. Otherwise, all canidates (of generic callables) is considered.

This process employs the usage of [type constraint][Type constraints] system of
Kotlin, similar to the process of
[determining function applicability][Determining function applicability for a specific call].
For every two members of the candidate set (let's call them $F_1$ and $F_2$),
the following constraint system is constructed and solved:

- For every non-default argument of the call the corresponding value parameters'
  types $X_1, X_2, X_3 ... X_N$ of $F_1$ and value parameters' types $Y_1, Y_2, Y_3 ... Y_N$
  of $F_2$ a type constraint $X_K <: Y_K$ is built. During construction of these
  constraints, all the type parameters of $F_1$ are considered bound and all the
  type parameters of $F_2$ are considered free;
- All the declaration-site type constraints of $X_1, X_2, X_3 ... X_N$ and
  $Y_1, Y_2, Y_3 ... Y_N$ are also added to the system.

If this constraint system is sound, it means that $F_1$ is equally or more applicable
as an overload candidate. After that the check is repeated with $F_1$ and $F_2$ swapped.
If $F_1$ is equally or more applicable than $F_2$ and $F_2$ is equally or more applicable
than $F_1$, this means that the two callables are equally applicable and an additional
decision procedure needs to be invoked.

All the members of the overload candidate set are sorted according to the criteria
of applicability, determining the most applicable callable. If there are several
callables which are both more applicable than other candidates and equally applicable
to each other, an additional step is performed:

- For each candidate, the number of default parameters not specified in the call is counted;
- The candidate with the least default parameters is a more specific candidate;
- If the number of defaulted parameters is equal for several candidates,
  the candidate having any variable-argument parameters is less specific than
  any candidate without them.

If, even after this additional step, there are several candidates that are equally
applicable for the call, there is an **overload ambiguity** that must be reported
as a compiler error.

> Note: Please note that, unlike the applicability test, the candidate comparison
> constraint system is **not** based on the actuall call, meaning that when comparing
> two candidates, only constraints visible at declaration site apply.

### About type inference

[Type inference][Type inference] in Kotlin is a pretty complicated process, which is
performed after resolving all the overload candidates. Due to the complexity of
the process, type inference may not affect the way overload resolution candidate
is picked up.
